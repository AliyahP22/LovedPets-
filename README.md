Welcome to Loved Pets
This is a site for all pet lovers or anyone interested in adopting a pet, becoming a volunteer to our shelter.... or maybe both!! 

Here at Loved Pets, we have a varitey of pet species, such as dogs, cats, turtles and all sorts of cute creatures who are hoping to get a forever home. We hope that our interactive site would make 
your adoption process more smooth. 

We are also open to have new volunteers in our team! If you would like to help our furry friends with feeding, bathing, and of course playing, please complete the application process and background screening. 

To learn more, see our contact information listed in our site!!
